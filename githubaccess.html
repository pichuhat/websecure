  How to submit your idea
  </h1>
  When you go to the github page (Linked at the bottom, but read this first), You do a pull request (suggestion) to make a new file.
  <br>
  Name the file: [username]-[number of suggestions made by you]-suggestion.html
  <br>
  [username] is your username
  [number of suggestions you made] is the number of suggestions you have made, NOT including this one.
  <br>
  (Ex. A person with a username of "Jeff" would make their file name Jeff-0-suggestion.html)
